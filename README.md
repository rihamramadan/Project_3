Enron Salary Data - Initial Data Set

Testing Data - Trimmed Data Set that keeps employees who have at least 70% of the data as non null. Output is "enron_test_data.csv", which is used for the "Trimmed" models

Data Cleaning - Enron Salary Data with Total with NaN changed to numeric values. Output is "enron_salary_numeric.csv", which is used for the "Numeric" models

Enron_Linear_Regression_Numeric.ipynb - Linear regression model using full "Numeric" dataset.

Enron_Linear_Regression_Trimmed.ipynb - Linear regression model using "Trimmed" dataset.

random_forest_enron_numeric.ipynb - Random Forest model using "Numeric" dataset.

random_forest_enron_trimmed.ipynb - Random Forest model using "Trimmed" dataset.

enron_graphs - Code to create Matplotlib graphs for data exploration.

enron_KNN_numeric.ipynb - K Nearest Neighbor for Numeric data

enron_KNN_Trimmed.ipynb - K Nearest Neightbor for Trimmed data
